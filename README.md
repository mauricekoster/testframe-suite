As from version 2013.x the toolbar will be developed using C#, WPF, Excel-DNA and Net Office.
It should work on all versions of Microsoft Office 32 and 64 bit.

PLEASE USE/CREATE A TEST ACTIONWORD DATABASE, not a production database!


64-BIT support
==============

64bit Office (2010+) is supported. However the original Jet engine is not available for 64-bit OS.
Therefore a new drivers needs to be installed:

Please install this driver.
